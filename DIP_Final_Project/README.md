# Image Forgery Detection
1. This is the final Project for Digital Image Processing Course. The objective is to detect if an image is tampered(Copy-Move) or not. 
2. Copy Move Forgery is a major tampering technique where a part of the image is copied and pasted within the image to mislead or cover something. 

- There are two major methods of detecting this. Block-based and Key-point based.

- This is a Key-point based method. We are using SIFT Key-points to detect tampering because it is resistive to scaling, rotating and intensity change effects on the copied region.

- The images folder contains both original and tampered images.

- Most of the code is documented, for further explanation refer this [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c8ZAFyZkamRC_VXKWdFOpWS_Ew4iMohYs6nykHEJhy4/edit?usp=sharing)
